Breast cancer remains one of the deadliest diseases worldwide. In this project, I employed various machine learning techniques to develop a model for predicting the malignancy of breast cancer using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (Diagnostic).
Aim and Objective: This project aims to assist medical professionals in identifying the most effective algorithm for breast cancer diagnosis. The objective is to select a model with high accuracy in distinguishing between benign (normal cells) and malignant (cancerous cells) tumors.
Work Procedure: The project began with data analysis and preprocessing. This involved data cleaning to eliminate missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical ones, and normalizing the data to a standard range. These steps ensure unbiased contributions from all features during analysis.
Next, the data was trained using various classification algorithms available in the Scikit-learn library, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classification, and Random Forest Classification. Each algorithm was utilized to learn patterns and predict cancerous features.
Result: All algorithms contributed effectively to the model, with Random Forest Classification emerging as the most accurate, achieving 95% accuracy and 92% precision. The model demonstrated a high recall rate of 95% during evaluation using appropriate metrics.
Conclusion: Through implementing these algorithms, predictive models were developed that can aid healthcare professionals in diagnosing breast cancer with high accuracy and reliability. This project not only enhances understanding of machine learning and data analysis techniques but also underscores their potential in medical diagnostics.
